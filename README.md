A low-latency render the HTML components made for pure Golang Components

This is, somewhat, under development. Mostly for my amusement at the moment

## Examples

* [Hello World ](examples/hello_world/main.go) - A very simple hello world example
* [Using Arrays](examples/arrays/main.go) - A slightly more complex example in which we emit nodes using arrays
* [Using Channels](examples/channels/main.go) - Sometimes using external systems is needed. This shows how we can
  emit Nodes from channels
* [Caching](examples/caching/main.go) - We can also cache slow IO operations
